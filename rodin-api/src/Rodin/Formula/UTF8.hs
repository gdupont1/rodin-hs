Module      : Rodin.Formula.UTF8
Description : Module for converting formula tokens to UTF8 strings
Copyright   : Copyright (C) 2019 G. Dupont
License     : GPL-3
Maintainer  : guillaume.dupont@irit.fr

This modules provide a mapping between 'Rodin.Formula.Token's and UTF-8 strings
and characters. This mapping serves to purposes: on the one hand it can be used
to print formulas in UTF-8, but on the other hands it can be used "reversely" to
guess an operator/token type based on its printing.
